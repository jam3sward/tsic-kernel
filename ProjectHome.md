This is a Kernel Module for the TSIC 306 Digital Temperature Sensor, developed for my own purposes. It currently supports a single sensor, with a programmable GPIO pin number. It is tested and working on Raspberry Pi (Raspbian).

Future plans include:
  * Support for multiple sensors on different GPIO pins
  * Using it to make perfect Espresso :)
